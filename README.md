PCI-DSS Recon and Vulnerability Report Tool
```
This tool is designed to perform PCI-DSS-compliant reconnaissance with advanced evasion techniques using Nmap, and generate detailed vulnerability reports in HTML, JSON, and DOCX formats.

It helps auditors and security professionals conduct stealthy scans and document the findings in a structured format, suitable for audit records or compliance reports.
```
Features
```
Port Scanning with Evasion: Leverages Nmap with evasion flags such as fragmenting packets, modifying TTL, using decoys, etc.

Profile-based Scanning: Currently supports pci-core and custom scanning profiles.

HTML Report Generation: Nicely formatted HTML report using a Jinja2 template.

JSON Report Option: Machine-readable output for integrations.

DOCX Report Output: Automatically fills a vulnerability table in a .docx file.
